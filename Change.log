	Avoid clean deleting everything if arg forgotten

Change 3406 on 2004/07/20 by nick@llama

	Add sampa refs

	latter have been tidied.

Change 3396 on 2004/07/11 by nick@llama

	Re-arrange vowels according to theory.
	Possibly /V/ now sounds odd for RP, otherwise largely
	harmless to RP as there are 'dip' targets for /a/ etc.
	Now nasals and rhotic versions need work to match.

Change 3395 on 2004/07/11 by nick@llama

	Feature re-ordering

Change 3394 on 2004/07/11 by nick@llama

	Add display of f2/f3 space

Change 3393 on 2004/07/11 by nick@llama

Change 3392 on 2004/07/11 by nick@llama

	Move dynamic element /#/ (to coin a code) so we can hear
	what different points sound like.

Change 3391 on 2004/07/11 by nick@llama

	Move /}/ f2 back a bit, add element to use as dynamic one.

	UTF-8 for most files.

Change 3375 on 2004/06/30 by nick@llama

	Re-instate ability to prune rules in multi-pass
	train.

Change 3374 on 2004/06/29 by nick@llama

	Sanitize Elements.def a bit
	 - Collapse two virtually identical versions of /a/
	 - Only generate nasals from non-diphthong vowels
	 - name elements in SAMPA while messing with them
	Add elmdgm to show vowels + /w/ and /j/ in IPA font.
	 - suggests some of vowels are off track, or f1/f2 theory
	   is wrong.

Change 3370 on 2004/06/28 by nick@dromedary

	Add nasals - suspect lengths are wrong

Change 3369 on 2004/06/28 by nick@dromedary

	Avoid outputing vectors from unproven parts of recursion.
	Repeat vectors for number of words to change weightings.
	Both versions of id3 giving errors which are odd e.g.
	'sin' 'sIn' is covered by vector at all times but is output as sn?

Change 3335 on 2004/06/15 by nick@llama

	Intermediate point with vectors as data

Change 3329 on 2004/06/14 by nick@llama

	Use perltidy on id3
	Also fix quoting of literals - which now makes perl version BETTER
	than C version (still a mystery why they differ, but have a clue now).
	So now small case is 77.6% correct :-)

Change 3328 on 2004/06/13 by nick@llama

	More comments in perl-generated tree
	Still Not clear why it makes more errors.

Change 3327 on 2004/06/13 by nick@llama

	Try and understand id3
	 - id3.c simplify to perl only style and some tidyup
	   still only 74% correct on small.dat
	 - Fish perl version of id3 out of archive and -w use strict
	   works again (fast enough on 21st Century machine)
	 - Produces radically differrt decision tree given same data
	   as C version which only gets 54% correct.

	Some command line options to try things

Change 3313 on 2004/06/08 by nick@llama

	Scheme to back-convert ARPAbet of CMU/BEEP to SAMPA
	Shows both dictionaries are full junk.
	 - CMU is better of two. Its main snag are lots of Polish/Chinese
	   proper names, and more (un-tagged of course) abbreviations.
	   Also a whole raft of McWhatever names.
	 - BEEP however has lots of "just wrong" entries and
	   some correct words pronounciations associated with either
	   unrelated word or it misspelt orthographicaly.

Change 3312 on 2004/06/08 by nick@llama

	Typo E21 for EH2

Change 3311 on 2004/06/08 by nick@llama

	Collect all dB adjustments of /^a\w+/ paramters into one place.

Change 2611 on 2003/01/02 by nick@dromedary

	[E] and [{] seemed to be swapped.
	Extraction of F1..F3 from CD is less helpful than expected
	very hard to get John and Jill's cardinal vowels to look
	right on tkvdgm.

	Tweak near-equivalence script, avoid $Id$ in phtoelm.def

	Drop 'stdy' slot in element data and use stdy*(1-prop) instead.
	(Having established that making all data was like that did
	        not make things worse.)

Change 2603 on 2003/01/01 by nick@dromedary

	Prune the #if 0 code now that new voice scheme and removal
	of 1st difference seems to work.
	Also re-instate long mis-understood 'avc' parameter.

	Remove some entries for words written the same but 
	with different pronounciation when latter cause poblems
	e.g. we want gin to be [dZIn] not [gIn] (Latter seems wrong)
	and put to be [pUt] not golfer's [pVt].

Change 2601 on 2002/12/31 by nick@dromedary

	More oddities - none of stops "stop" - weird - added
	no-source and external duration to KY GY and seems to help
	(Do same for [bptd]?)

Change 2600 on 2002/12/31 by nick@dromedary

	Velars [kg] had no stimulus on in/out - no wonder they were weak!

Change 2598 on 2002/12/30 by nick@dromedary

	"Restore" naive "f0 decline with stress pulses" approach for 
	un-assisted text-to-speech. Festival as a front end is

	Gate more messages with -v (verbose) switch

Change 2594 on 2002/12/28 by nick@dromedary

	Another try at ms -> num-of-frames interpolation.

	Turn of debug :-(

Change 2588 on 2002/12/28 by nick@dromedary

	Improve mbrola .pho file interpollation:
	  - allow length reduction for non stops
	  - invent new attribute 'stl' (stop locus) to mark in/out
	    elements of stops so only central part is marked as stp
	    (with above this means in/put can change length).
	         - Remove specific [A:] etc. entries in phtoelem.def and handle
	           ':' in phtoelm.c 

Change 2587 on 2002/12/28 by nick@dromedary

	At least attempt all vowels on IPA diagram.
	(Missing ones F1,F2,F2 from IPA CD.)

	reasons ;-)

Change 2574 on 2002/12/23 by nick@dromedary

	#if to switch between taking 1st diff of output + lowpass
	or not doing either (supposed to be equivalent).
	The non-diff case should make it easier to inject specific 
	voice waveform.

Change 2573 on 2002/12/23 by nick@dromedary

	Some light tidying

Change 2570 on 2002/12/22 by nick@dromedary

	Update comments, experiment with pitch-sync cascade update

Change 2564 on 2002/12/19 by nick@dromedary

	Tune [N] based on tkscope analysis of "Sounds of IPA" CD

	Place holders for high central vowels [1] and [}]

Change 2545 on 2002/12/09 by nick@dromedary

	Add x-sampa [4] [K] [?]

Change 2544 on 2002/12/04 by nick@dromedary

	Restore speed from -S 
	 - some clicks seem to be "rapid" changes in f2 
	          i.e. go away with more steps as in -S 10 -m 1 

Change 2543 on 2002/12/04 by nick@dromedary
